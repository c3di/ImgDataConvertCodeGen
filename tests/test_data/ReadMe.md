# Test Data

* nodes_examples contains the data used to create the nodes in the graph.

* edge_factory_examples provides the logic to create edges between nodes based on certain conditions or rules.

* knowledge_graph_example consists of 5 nodes, each uniquely identified by an integer label from 1 to 5 and 5 directed edges (1 -> 2, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 1, 3 -> 4, 4 -> 5).
